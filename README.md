this datapack adds an arrows quiver to minecraft  
the quiver is fully compatible with every enchantment in the game  
you can add any arrow to a quiver by selecting the quiver in you mainhand and putting arrows in you offhand and shift-right-clicking  
the quiver can store up to max of 192 arrows (3 stacks)  
you can only have one quiver in you inventory at a time (unfortunately i havent found a way to enforce it, so just pay attention to that)  
you can however have a quiver and arrows at the same time, arrows from the quiver will be prioritized  
you can craft the quiver as follows: (1st row: air, air, leather) (2nd row: string, rabbit_hide, leather) (3rd row: same as second)  

!!! IMPORTANT !!!  
THIS DATAPACK HAS A CORRESPONDING RESOURCEPACK (QuiverRP)
